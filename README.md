# Battleship-Solitaire
In this assignment for CSC384, I wrote a program to solve Battleship Solitaire puzzles. This required me to encode these puzzles as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and implement a CSP solver.

Battleship Solitaire is similar to the Battleship board gameLinks to an external site.. Unlike the 2-player board game, Battleship Solitaire shows the number of ship parts in each row and column, and your goal is to deduce the location of each ship.
